<h3>My Rendezvous with Various Coding Challenges</h3>
<h4>This is a repository of various coding challenges that I have completed. They are primarily codewars challenges (Kata) at this time.</h4>

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<h4> And a touch of willpower </h4>

<p>I find that starting the day with a coding challenge is the perfect way to stretch those precious critical thinking skills.
<br>(and gives me something to obcess over for the rest of the day if I've stretched a little too far)</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>What a bland journey this life would be if one did not learn new things - and often - if we are lucky. As I learn new techniques from my own experience, watching and working with others, walking down the street as a moment of random inspiration strikes... I always like to go back and revisit old solutions to compare how I did it then with how I might do it now. As I learn and grow, I like to refactor and redesign my past solutions for clarity, efficiency, or just for the fun of trying it a new way.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I think the biggest lesson I have learned from tackling these challenges is the value of stepping away and coming back with a fresh perspective. The amount of hours I have spent banging my head against a challenge I couldn't quite get right only to have the solution come to me right after I walk away to relax and do something else is not a number I wish to admit to. 
<br>Other than the greater life lessons of patience and letting things go, I find that looking at how others went about tackling a challenge and comparing it to my own method is extremely valuable and shows you ways to solve problems that I may not have thought to try.</p>
